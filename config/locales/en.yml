  how_we_work: "HOW DO WE WORK"
  how_we_work_text_1: "Every time we start a new project, we do a great research on the domain of the project. This helps us to stay in touch with the essence of our work and create things keeping in mind how, when and by whom they’re going to be used. It is a great part of the project, maybe even the most important one. "
  how_we_work_text_2: "After uploading lots of information and knowledge about clients business to our heads, we start our creative process. That’s when it all comes out, on our papers and monitors. By carefully evaluating each possible solution we come to the most elegant, convenient and useful one. After presenting the solution to our client, we listen to the feedback with all our attention, notebooks and pencils. Then we discuss the feedback and improve our solution according to that. As close as it can be to the client’s needs, the final design is now born."
  how_we_work_text_3: "However, birth is just the beginning, right? We like to watch our creations rise. We help them develop, gain new skills and evolve as every timeless creation do. Support is a great part of our work, our deep concernment and communication skills help us make good friends with our clients. Together we lead our creations to the bright future."
  things_we_like: "THINGS WE LIKE"
  things_we_like_text_1: "Besides the design and nicely designed things, we’re also keen on everything that has a seal of a creative mind on it. We love music. A lot. Music of different kinds and genres. And that often leads to flaming debates on whose playlist is playing today. In addition, we cannot forget about graphic art and architecture, which we’re lucky to observe here in Prague on a daily basis. This city truly inspires us with its beauty, cultural richness and arty atmosphere."
  things_we_like_text_2: "Apart from that, every one of us is either a passionate sportsman or supporter. We like to watch and play football and hockey, although we support different (rival, sometimes) teams. We support the healthy way of living and like to make our way to work by bike."
  things_we_like_text_3: "Random stuff, members of our team like: robots, dogs, b movies, camping, Czech beer, cartoons, Scarlett Johansson, flip-flops, hypnocat, lost Mesoamerican civilizations, time travel, sneakers, FSM, comic strips, metal boxes, bananas, drums, secret parties, mafia suits, staplers."
